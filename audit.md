# Repository Audit Documentation By Favourite Jome

## Folder Structure Overview

- **`docs/`** – Main documentation (guides, references, how‑tos).
- **`tutorials/`** – Step-by-step learning materials.
- **`blog/`** – Posts for announcements, updates, and stories.
- **`pages/`** – Standalone pages (home, about, etc.) outside the main docs.
- **`src/`** – Custom components, styles, and overrides.
- **`static/`** – Images, files, and assets served directly.
- **Root config files** – `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`, `package.json`, etc., control site setup, navigation, and dependencies.

## What Can Be Improved

1. **Merge or Clarify `docs/` vs `tutorials/`**  
   Decide whether tutorials should be inside `docs/` or remain separate, and make navigation clear.

2. **Organize Docs with Categories**  
   Group related content under clear sections (e.g., *Get Started*, *Concepts*, *How‑to Guides*, *Reference*).

3. **Add Consistent Metadata**  
   Ensure each page has frontmatter with `title`, `description`, and `tags` for better SEO and sidebar consistency.

4. **Improve Blog Structure**  
   Add author profiles, tags, and a standard format for release notes or updates.

5. **Enhance Navigation**  
   Update the navbar and sidebars to make Docs, Tutorials, and Blog easy to find.

**In short:** The repo has a good starting structure, but clearer separation of content types, consistent standards, and small navigation tweaks will make it easier to maintain and more user-friendly.
